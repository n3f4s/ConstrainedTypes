# ContrainedTypes
Library for defining constrained types (Ada-like constrained types)

This is, for now, a exercise library. I hope it will one day become good enough to be used in real project.

For now, it has been tested only on linux (with g++ and clang++)

The purpose of this library is to easily create constrained type by composing
types and constraints.
This is done by composing templates types.

__This library will evolve (and break compatibility)__

See src/main.cpp to know how to use this constrained type (the API is not stable that's why there is no documentation)
